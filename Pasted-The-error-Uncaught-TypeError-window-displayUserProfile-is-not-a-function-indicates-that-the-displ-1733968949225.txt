The error "Uncaught TypeError: window.displayUserProfile is not a function" indicates that the displayUserProfile function is not accessible in the global scope where it's being called. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Scope Issues:

    Function Scope: If the displayUserProfile function is defined within a specific function or block, it's not accessible outside that scope.
    Module Scope: If you're using a module system like CommonJS or ES Modules, ensure that the function is exported correctly and imported where it's needed.

2. Asynchronous Operations:

    If the displayUserProfile function is defined within an asynchronous operation (e.g., a Promise or callback), make sure it's available after the asynchronous operation completes.
    Use async/await or Promises to handle asynchronous operations and ensure the function is accessible when needed.

3. Timing Issues:

    If the function is defined after it's being called, the browser might not have access to it yet.
    Ensure that the function is defined before it's used.

Potential Solutions:

    Global Scope:
        If you want the displayUserProfile function to be accessible globally, define it outside of any functions or modules.
        However, be cautious about polluting the global namespace.

    Module System:
        If you're using a module system, export the function from the module where it's defined and import it into the module where it's needed.

    Asynchronous Operations:
        Use async/await or Promises to handle asynchronous operations and ensure the function is available when needed.

Example:
JavaScript

// Assuming you're using a module system like CommonJS or ES Modules

// In your profile.js module:
export async function displayUserProfile(userId) {
  // ... your function implementation
}

// In your main.js module:
import { displayUserProfile } from './profile';

// ... event listener or other code where you want to call the function
document.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  if (event.target.classList.contains('user-profile-link')) {
    const userId = event.target.dataset.userId;
    displayUserProfile(userId);
  }
});
